# UFO PCB Lamp

### Overview:
This is a PCB lamp that I started in a workshop. The PCB light ring and [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense-rev2/) board were provided. Instructions from the workshop are [here](https://hackaday.io/project/192881/instructions).

I later expanded upon the provided arduino code and created the 3d models using Onshape so that it looks like a UFO. The lamp operates using the Rev2 board's proximity and gesture sensors.

### To Do:
Future plans include: <br/>
[ ] Improve 3d model fit <br/>
[ ] Rewrite code for clarity <br/>
[ ] Add switch <br/>
[ ] Use bluetooth and connect it using python <br/>
